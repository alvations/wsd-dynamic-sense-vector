## Setup

    pip3 install --user beautifulsoup4 sklearn testfixtures unittest2 pyemd morfessor
    pip3 install --user pandas==0.20.3 seaborn==0.8.1
    pip3 install --user spacy 
    pip3 install --user https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_md-1.2.1/en_core_web_md-1.2.1.tar.gz
    python3 -m spacy link en_core_web_md en_default
    pip3 install --user nltk
    python3 -m nltk.downloader wordnet
    pip3 install --user tensorflow-gpu
    pip3 install --user docopt

Put a link to your copy of Gigaword 5th edition

    ln -s /path/to/gigaword/5ed data/gigaword

Install the modified version of gensim in order to train sense embeddings.

    ./install-gensim-modified.sh

Make sure you have a Java JDK installed.

### Specific instructions for DAS-5

If you get error `No module named 'pip'` while importing spacy, you might want
to log in to one of the compute nodes and install pip.
For example:

    ssh node057
    easy_install-3.4 --user pip
    python3 -c 'import pip'
    exit

If you get `No module named 'UserString'` while loading a Word2vec model from
disk, probably it is caused by the difference between compute node and login
node. You might ssh to one of the compute nodes to continue your work.

### Specific instructions for training sense embeddings

    cd data
    wget http://lcl.uniroma1.it/wsdeval/data/WSD_Training_Corpora.zip
    unzip WSD_Training_Corpora.zip


### Specific instructions for Babelfied Wikipedia conversion

1. `wget` Babelfied Wikipedia in XML from [here](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelfied-wikipedia/files/babelfied-wikipediaXML.tar.gz) and untar it.
2. make sure the variable **main_input_folder** in scripts/convertbn2wn_v2.py points to the untarred folder from step 1.
3. Depending on the number of CPU's in the environment in which you run the conversion, indicate how many parallel processes you want to run by changing the value of the variable **num_workers** in scripts/convertbn2wn_v2.py line 43.
4. Conversion was tested in python3.5 with the following external modules:
	* lxml (lxml.etree version 3.6.4)
	* nltk (version 3.2.1)
	* pandas (version 0.18.1)

## Steps

### Input training sense embeddings

Set the following experiment settings in `scripts/semcor_format2LSTM_input.py`. The current settings are:

    wn_version = '30'
    corpora_to_include = ['semcor', 'mun']  # semcor | mun
    accepted_pos = {'NOUN'}
    entailment_setting = 'any_hdn'  # lemma_hdn | any_hdn`

Train by running:

    cd scripts
    python3 semcor_format2LSTM_input.py

### For word2vec model

1. Pre-process GigaWord into plain text: `python3 process-gigaword.py > output/gigaword.txt`
1. Create a word2vec model from Gigaword corpus:
`./train-word-embeddings.sh output/gigaword.txt output/gigaword`
2. Extract BabelNet-to-WordNet mappings: `./extract-bn-wn-mappings.sh`
3. Convert [Babelfied Wikipedia](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelfied-wikipedia/)
	* `cd scripts`
	* `python convertbn2wn_v2.py`
4. Train sense embeddings: `./train-sense-embeddings.sh`
5. Check your sense embeddings: `python3 examine-sense-embeddings.py`

### Reproduction paper

Requirements: You'll need at least 64 GB of RAM to run the preparation script. 

#### Convert annotated corpora into input format LSTM

0. cd script
1. bash convert_for_paper.sh 
The bash file calls the python script sense_annotations2lstm_format.py, which converts the sense annotations into the format needed to train the embeddings at the preferred granularity level (sensekey or synset).

#### label propagation

After running the `sense_annotations2lstm_format.py` with OMSTI as corpus, the output of that run needs to be provided as an argument to `pwgc_to_ulm.py`.
This creates a development set for the label propagation:
a) annotated corpus: pwgc
b) unannotated corpus: omsti

#### Model size experiements

Notice that there was uncertainty about the real version that produce h2048p512
and h512p128, see `difference-edited.txt` for a comparison with a recent version.

1. h=2048, p=512: `git checkout 354acc1cfdd542142490afe40447cb6f40d2fd7c && ./train-lstm-wsd-full-data-google-model.job`
2. h=512, p=128: `git checkout 354acc1cfdd542142490afe40447cb6f40d2fd7c && ./train-lstm-wsd-full-data-large-model.job`
3. h=512, p=64: see `exp-h256p64.sh` in "stability" section
4. h=100, p=10: see `exp-variation*.job` in "stability" section

#### Reproduce variation/stability experiments

These experiments measure how much the performance is affected by the randomness
in training. Basically, we train smaller models many times, each time with 
a different (but fixed) random seed.

1. Pre-process GigaWord into plain text: `git checkout 694cb4d && sbatch process-gigaword.job`
2. More preprocessing to make binary files: `git checkout a453bc1 && sbatch cartesius/prepare-lstm-wsd.job`
0. `git checkout ce8a024`
1. Run at the same time: `sbatch cartesius/exp-variation1.job` and `cartesius/sbatch exp-variation2.job`
0. `git checkout a74bda6`
2. Preprocess to make binary files (the format is slightly different from the previous version): `sbatch cartesius/prepare-lstm-wsd.job`
3. `git checkout e93fdb2`
4. Run `cartesius/exp-h256p64.sh` (which calls `sbatch`)
2. When everything finishes, do `git checkout 42bc700` 
3. Run `sbatch cartesius/exp-variation-score.job`

#### Reproduce (training speed) optimization experiment

1. Pre-process GigaWord into plain text (if you haven't done so): `git checkout a74bda6 && sbatch process-gigaword.job`
0. `git checkout a74bda6`
2. More preprocessing to make binary files: `sbatch cartesius/prepare-lstm-wsd.job`
3. `git checkout e93fdb2`
4. Run in parallel: `sbatch cartesius/exp-optimization{i}.job` where i=1,2,3,4

#### Data size experiment

1. Pre-process GigaWord into plain text (if you haven't done so): `git checkout 694cb4d && sbatch process-gigaword.job`
0. `git checkout a74bda6`
2. More preprocessing to make binary files: `sbatch cartesius/prepare-lstm-wsd.job`
3. `git checkout 4e4a04a`
4. Run `sbatch cartesius/exp-data-size.job {i}` with i="01",10,25,50,75

#### Hyperparameter tuning for label propagation

1. TODO @Marten: how to create debug.lp and debug.lp.gold
2. `git checkout 0448586`
3. `das5/exp-hyperp-label-propagation.sh` (which calls `sbatch`)
